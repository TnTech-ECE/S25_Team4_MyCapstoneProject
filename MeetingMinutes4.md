The second round of peer review for the project proposal has started for all teams (except for the team that got through round one). For the project proposal, comments have been received by the customer, Dr. Kinmonth and the proposal will be revamped in accordance to her comments. Some things that will be changed will be the BOM, shall statements, and general grammar. 

## Future plans

* Team will meet with customer for further specifications like temperature and layout of greenhouse.
* Decision on implementation using pre-existing greenhouse or greenhouse from scratch.
* Individual hardware designation specifcations will be determined once previous points are done.
* Team will meet with Dr. Kinmonth for a tour of the Tech's greenhouse and send revised project proposal to Dr. Kinmonth.
* The proposal will be revamped to include a two step plan for goals.
* Specifications will be added to include more details in the proposal.
