## Key Points
### (Applies to all team members)

Project proposal has passed peer review stages and is now awaiting for approval from the instructor. The team has met with the customer last week and gained more information pertaining to the specifications of the sensory network devices and chasis housing the device network. The decision on the implementation will be to implement in multiple greenhouses due to differing dimensions. This way, the modularity element is properly tested. Once the project proposal passes, the conceptual design process will be in process.

## Future plans

* Team will meet with Dr. Kinmonth this week to talk about Oakley Farms.
* Team will address Instrutor Micah's comments on GitHub (when applicable).
* Team will start on Conceptual Design once Proposal has been approved by Instructor.
* Team will meet with Advisor Dr. Rizvi to talk about Conceptual Design.
