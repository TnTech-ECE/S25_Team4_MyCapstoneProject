# Physical Detailed Design

This document presents a comprehensive overview of the Physical Subsystem, one of the four key components of the greenhouse monitoring solutionâ€”the others being the Power Subsystem, Central Processing Hub Subsystem, and Mechanical Subsystem. The Physical Subsystem is on the lower end of the components but requires a decent about of tinkering to get accurate. The document further outlines the technical constraints, relevant industry standards, and operational limitations that influence the design and deployment of the Physical Subsystem. Lastly, it details the step-by-step procedure for constructing and implementing the subsystem as part of the overall greenhouse monitoring solution.
